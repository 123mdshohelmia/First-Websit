                Web designer. Is it just us, or does that have a nice ring to it? And it’s not just a catchy title—learning web design can lead to an exciting and fascinating career, especially for a creative problem-solver like you. But just the idea of getting started
                in web design can be overwhelming. Maybe you’re secretly thinking: what do web designers do? Or maybe even: what is web design? (Yes, we were there at one point, too!) As you consider whether web design is the right career path for you,
                you need some answers to the big questions: What do you really need to know? Should you learn to code? What tools do you need to have? How about managing clients?
